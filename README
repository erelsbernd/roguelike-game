For this assignment I implemented 2 suggestions of Dr. Sheaffer: ranged combat and printing a description of the items and monsters in the same room as PC. I started by adding the rangedCombat() method in UI. I used the selectTarget() method to get an initial target and use the vnpcv and getLocation to get location of target npc. I then updated the damage of the npc and checked to see if it was killed. If it was killed I set it to null on the map and set the character to dead. To implement ranged combat, I have the user press ‘r’ and use the arrow keys to select the target monster. They then press spacebar to attack. To display a list of item/monster descriptions in the room, I created new methods for both features separately. For monsters, the user presses ‘z’ which calls cellDescriptionMonsters(), which calls selectTargetMonsters() to get initial target and then goes through vnpcv as the user selects other targets. The user finds and selects monsters with arrow keys and spacebar. selectTargetMonsters() calls mListSelectForDescription() which takes the index of the monster and displays appropriate description and stats of the monster. For displaying items in the room I created similar methods and used a similar process; however, I added some public get and setItemLocation methods to get the item location. To get the items in the room, the user must press ‘d’ and then spacebar after selecting the item. I also had to check to make sure the item was in the room, and made an Item vector of all items in the room for the selection process. This was because I ran into the problem of all items in the dungeon being able to be selected. Overall, I was successful in implementing my goals for this assignment.
